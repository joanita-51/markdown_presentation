## What is a markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is widely used for formatting plain text.
It was created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004 to allow people to write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format that could be converted into HTML. Markdown is often used for writing documentation, README files, forum posts, and other types of content where simple formatting is needed.

## Simple Syntax
Markdown uses a simple and intuitive syntax to format text. 
It employs symbols like asterisks, underscores, and hashes to indicate formatting elements such as headings, lists, emphasis (bold or italic), and more.

## Headings
Headings are created using hash symbols (#)

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

## Italic Text
Italic text is created using either asterisk (*) or underscores (_). 

```
*italic* or _italic_.
```
## Lists
Unordered lists can be created using asterisks (*), plus (+), or hyphens (-).

```
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Subitem 2.1
  * Subitem 2.2
```
Ordered lists are created using numbers followed by a period (1., 2., etc.).
```
 1. Item 1
 2. Item 2
    1. Subitem 2.1
    2. Subitem 2.2
```

## Links and Images 
You can create hyperlinks and embed images using a similar syntax.

```

## Code Blocks
Code blocks are created by indenting lines with four spaces or by using triple backticks (```).

    hello there


## Horizontal Rules 
You can create horizontal rules with three or more hyphens (---), asterisks (***), or underscores (___).

```
***No smoking***
```

## Escape Characters
If you want to use a character that has a special meaning in Markdown (like an asterisk or underscore) as a literal character, you can escape it with a backslash (\)

```
\*Have fun today
